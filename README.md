# Sushi-Catcher
This repository contains all the files needed for my CGRA151 Final Project in Trimester 2 2020. I created a game where the player needs to move the mouse to move the bowl to catch sushi.

In this game, the bowl can be moved horizontally using the mouse.

There are three game modes:
1. EASY -> the player must catch sushi which appear in the screen and avoid COVID-19.
2. MEDIUM -> the player must catch sushi which appear in the screen and avoid COVID-19. Besides, the player can also catch fish and shrimp for bonus points.
3. HARD -> the player must only catch sushi which is as indicated at the top of the screen.

In each of the game modes above, the player will have three lives. Catching COVID-19, missing sushi, or catching sushi which is not as indicated at the top of the screen (for "HARD" mode only) will make the player lose a live in the game.

To play the game, Processing (https://processing.org/) needs to be installed on your machine before running the game.
